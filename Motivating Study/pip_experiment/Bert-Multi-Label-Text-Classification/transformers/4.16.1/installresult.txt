      error: failed to select a version for `env_logger`.
          ... required by package `tokenizers-python v0.21.0 (/tmp/pip-install-6y5jfxlz/tokenizers_d953f07482a246adb721633734f05bd6/bindings/python)`
      versions that meet the requirements `^0.11` (locked to 0.11.5) are: 0.11.5
      
      the package `tokenizers-python` depends on `env_logger`, with features: `anstream` but `env_logger` does not have these features.
       It has an optional dependency with that name, but that dependency uses the "dep:" syntax in the features table, so it does not have an implicit feature with that name.
