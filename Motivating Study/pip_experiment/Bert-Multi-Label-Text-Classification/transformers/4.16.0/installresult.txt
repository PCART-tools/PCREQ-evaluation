          ... required by package `tokenizers-python v0.21.0 (/tmp/pip-install-yg01fjdb/tokenizers_bdd9352c97424bb69d98e3373ed40d97/bindings/python)`
      versions that meet the requirements `^0.11` (locked to 0.11.5) are: 0.11.5
      
      the package `tokenizers-python` depends on `env_logger`, with features: `anstream` but `env_logger` does not have these features.
       It has an optional dependency with that name, but that dependency uses the "dep:" syntax in the features table, so it does not have an implicit feature with that name.
      
      
      failed to select a version for `env_logger` which could resolve this conflict
