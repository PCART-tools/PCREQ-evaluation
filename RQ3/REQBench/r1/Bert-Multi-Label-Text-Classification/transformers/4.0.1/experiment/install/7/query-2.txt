            **Task**
            Resolve pip install conflict in requirements.txt while preserving library integrity.

            **Input Context**
            - Current requirements.txt: transformers==4.0.1
torch==1.7.1
numpy==1.19.5
tokenizers==0.10.1
packaging==20.9
filelock==3.0.12
requests==2.25.1
tqdm==4.56.0
regex==2020.11.13
sacremoses==0.0.53

            - Python version: 3.7
            - PyPI metadata (including version constraints): 
            - Conflict error message: conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested tokenizers==0.10.1
    transformers 4.0.1 depends on tokenizers==0.9.4

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

            **Resolution Protocol**
            1. Parse conflict_info to identify:
            a. Direct conflicting packages
            b. Common dependency chains
            c. Python version constraints
            2. Apply minimum version adjustment strategy:
            a. Prioritize keeping transformers==4.0.1
            b. Modify other package versions only when necessary
            c. Maintain original library set

            **Hard Constraints**
            - STRICTLY MAINTAIN: 
            • transformers==4.0.1
            • Original library count
            - MUST ENSURE: 
            • Complete dependency tree compatibility
            • Python 3.7 support for all packages
            - STRICTLY PROHIBITED:
            • Adding/removing libraries
            • Version speculation without error evidence

            **Output Mandates**
            STRICT FORMAT:
            lib1==x.y.z  
            lib2==a.b.c
            ...
            PROHIBITED:
            • Any non-version text.
            • Library additions/removals
            • Version placeholders
            MANDATORY:
            • Preserve original library names and count
            • Pin EXACT versions
            • Zero explanations/comments
