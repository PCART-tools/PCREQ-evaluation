================================================================
Failed to import CuPy.

If you installed CuPy via wheels (cupy-cudaXXX or cupy-rocm-X-X), make sure that the package matches with the version of CUDA or ROCm installed.

On Linux, you may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable depending on how you installed CUDA/ROCm.
On Windows, try setting CUDA_PATH environment variable.

Check the Installation Guide for details:
  https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html

Original error:
  ImportError: libnvrtc.so.11.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
